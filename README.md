ABSTRACT   tt
Marking attendance has been one of the most important way to record and track the presence 
of students in schools, colleges. Attendance marking in different forms has been in use in 
various organization to record the presence of their human resource. This helps the organization in generating their month-end payroll, and other activities.

In this project, an attempt has been made to record attendance through mobile devices. The aim of the project is to create an Android mobile application for attendance system that can be used by all teachers for their respective courses. This application fetches the details of the courses allotted to the respective faculty and the students enrolled in the courses from the server using the internet connection and stores it in the mobile database. This application stores the attendance in the mobile internal database and the faculty can view and update the attendance whenever required. At the end of the month, when the faculty is needed to upload
the attendance, they can directly upload it from their mobile in the server provided the internet connection is available.

1.4 Objective
Design a Student attendance system to keep track of attendance in mobile devices for easy and proper evaluation of attendance.
1. Develop and implement an attendance system.
2. To create an Android mobile application to provide a User Interface to interact with the system.

1.5 Outline of thesis
The thesis consists of seven chapters following this chapter:
Chapter 2: General Description
we discuss about the General constraints, Product Prospective and User characteristics etc.
Chapter 3: Requirement analysis and speciation
we discuss about the functional requirements of the system, developed the SRS model of the system.
Chapter 4: Design
This chapter discusses different Design models. The Function Oriented design approach focuses on the functions of the system, the functionalities are represented with the help of DFD’s. The object oriented design approach focuses on the ER model of the system.
Chapter 5: UML modelling
UML is a modelling language that is used to specify, draw, visualize and document the parts of the software. Use case diagrams are the diagrammatic representation depicting user’s interactions with the system. and other diagrams are drawn in the same reference such as Class diagram, activity diagram and sequence diagram.
Chapter 6: Implementation
This chapter outlines the three tier architecture of the application developed. The Client side is the android application interface that is accessed by the user. MySql server acts as the back end.
Chapter 7: Graphical User Interface
This chapter describes the different user interfaces of the applications and the forms shown to the user.
